**Cube Notation**
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| R | Turn the right side clockwise.  |
| L | Turn the left side clockwise. |
| U | Turn the top (or up) side clockwise. |
| D | Turn the bottom (or down) side clockwise. |

- If you have a letter with an apostrophe, like R' it means turn the side counterclockwise.
- If you have a letter with a number after it like R2, it means turn the side that amount of times.
