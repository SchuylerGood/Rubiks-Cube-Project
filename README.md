# Rubiks-Cube-Project

### The goal with this project is to use a combination of logic and algorithms to make a program that can give us the directions to solve a Rubiks cube. The logic and backend aspects of the project will be written in Python, while the frontend and visual representation of the project will either be using a 3D Python library, or adapted into a web based application.

**Cube Notation**
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| R | Turn the right side clockwise.  |
| L | Turn the left side clockwise. |
| U | Turn the top (or up) side clockwise. |
| D | Turn the bottom (or down) side clockwise. |
| F | Turn the front clockwise |
| B | Turn the back clockwise |
- If you have a letter with an apostrophe, like R' it means turn the side counterclockwise.
- If you have a letter with a number after it like R2, it means turn the side that amount of times.
